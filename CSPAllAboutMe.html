	<h1> <b> Who I am </b> </h1>
	
	<p> My name is Veronica (no middle name) Garcia. I was born June 22, 1999 in Los Angeles and have lived in the same house,
	   with the same family, since I was born. I went to St. Paul’s School from first to eighth grade and have been at Notre Dame
	   Academy since freshman year. Some of my favorite pastimes include reading mushy YA books, playing frisbee with my older
	   sister, and  incessantly stressing about my future. </p>
	
	<h1> <b> My Family </b> </h1>
	
	<p> My parents were neighbors for years before they got married in 1986 in Durango, Mexico. About a year after they 
	   were married, they moved to LA and in 1993, my eldest sister, Alejandra, was born. Three years later, my older sister,
	   Lorena, was born and then three years after her, I was born. My parents have always been hardworking, over-protective, 
	   and awesome people. My dad was a pretty awesome charro as a teenager and young adult, and has always found a way to tell 
	   stories about his old rodeos to us growing up (he even has this *huge* portrait in the hallway).  He dreams about moving
	   back home to live at his father’s small ranch and just live out his days riding horses and wearing tejanas. My mom is
	   the funniest person I have ever met. It is impossible to be sad around her or stay angry with her for long. In addition 
	   to her sense of humor, she is the best mother ever. When I was baby, she decided to stop working in order to take care
	   of my sisters and I and we’ve been very lucky to have her around making sure that we grow up to be as awesome as her. </p> 

	<p> My eldest sister, Alejandra, is one of the best sisters ever. After her freshman year at LMU, she moved back home.
	  She graduated last year with a bachelors in accounting. Ale has been the one to always push me to do more academically.
	  She’s always been on top of me with application deadlines and encourages me to join clubs. Her hand-me-downs are 
	  experiences in high school and college and her advice has *always* been the best. My older sister, Lorena, is my partner
	  in crime. Unfortunately, she’s at Notre Dame de Namur in the Bay Area most of the year, but when she’s home, everyone
	  seems to lighten up a bit. She’s the one I have frisbee competitions with, and have Disney movie marathons on weekends
	  with. I love both my sisters very much and am very glad I get along so well with them. They’re probably the coolest
	 older sisters on Earth, but, then again, that’s just my opinion. </p>
	
	<h1> <b> My Goals </b> </h1>
	
	<p> When I grow up, I want to be an engineer. In order to get there, I need to get into college first *fingers crossed*.
	  I hope to get into my dream school, Columbia, but since it’s an ivy league, I have my back ups. I do hope to go to school
	  in the east coast since it’s always been my dream to live in a big east coast city, like NYC or Boston. If I do get into
	  Columbia *knock on wood*, I would love to study chemical engineering and get my degree. After college, I hope that I 
	  can make a career working in the food production industry, fixing agricultural dilemmas  or even help create a 
	  synthetic meat to put an end to the meat industry madness. My ultimate goal in life is to use my career to benefit
	  others. I really do hope that I can make a difference in people’s lives and maybe even win a Nobel Prize or two. </p>
