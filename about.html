      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome! We are R2G2, an all-girls robotics team from Notre Dame Academy High School. We are an elective class, not a club, that meets every Friday for 2 hours after school. This is our second year participating in VEX Robotics and we are ecstatic for all the opportunities that will allow us to demonstrate what we are capable of.
        R2G2 has 27 members, divided into two teams: the A team and B team.
        R2G2 was made possible by the Northrop Grumman grant.</p>
